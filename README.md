# 🚀 Dockerized Apache Web Server (Ubuntu + HTML)

This project demonstrates how to Dockerize a simple Apache web server using an Ubuntu base image to serve static HTML content. It is designed for environments where developers provide only HTML code and do not interact with Docker.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Dockerize a custom Apache web server using an Ubuntu base image.
- Copy static HTML code (provided by developers) into the container.
- Serve the HTML via Apache on port 80.
- Push the Docker image to Docker Hub for deployment or reuse.
